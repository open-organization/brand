The Open Organization project and community debuted a new logo and brand system in 2020.
This document provides guidelines for ensuring we deploy that brand consistently.

## Brand guidelines

Before working with our brand, read the guidelines.
Seriously.
Read the guidelines.
They offer specific instructions for ensuring consistency of branded materials.
You'll find them in this folder.

## Our logo

It looks like this:

![Open Organization project logomark](https://github.com/open-organization/brand/blob/main/logo/Logo-Open_Org-A-Standard-RGB.png "Open Organization project logomark")

It's available in standard, monochrome, and reverse-monochrome variants.

Open Organization Ambassadors can also use a custom logo that looks like this:

![Open Organization Ambassador logomark](https://github.com/open-organization/brand/blob/main/ambassador-logo/Logo-Open_Org-Ambassador-A-Standard-RGB.png "Open Organization Ambassador logomark")

It's also available in standard, monochrome, and reverse-monochrome variants.

## Our icon

We can use our project's icon independent of the entire logomark. It looks like this:

![Open Organization project icon](https://github.com/open-organization/brand/blob/main/icon/Asset-Red_Hat-Open_Org_Icon-A-Standard-RGB.png "Open Organization project icon")

It's available in standard, monochrome, and reverse-monochrome variants.

## Our font

Our community's font is Red Hat, a [free and openly licensed](https://github.com/RedHatOfficial/RedHatFont) typeface.
See our brand standards for instructions on using it.
Font files are included in this repository.

## Our palette

Our brand utilizes a [limited color palette](https://github.com/open-organization/brand/blob/main/palette.pdf) so we're recognizable wherever we show up.
When creating resources, we should ensure we're always wearing the right colors.
